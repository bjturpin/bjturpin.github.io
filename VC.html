<aside><p><center><h2>Switzerland - The Swiss Guard</h2></center></p> <p><strong>Use condotierri to sponsor a war in which France eliminates an Italian player.</strong></p>
<p>Switzerland is famous for our unique halberd-centric mercenaries.  Derivative of this, we have managed to become even more embroiled in Italian politics <em>than the Italians themselves.</em>  The French realize our superior military tactics and consistently employ us to facilitate their easterly ambitions.  We’re not sure whether it is their coin or their diplomats’ opinions on the Swiss that have advanced our position in the empire…but this is no time to change our method.</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Naples - Support Skanderbeg</h2></center></p> <p><strong>Share great-power status with a sovereign Albania.</strong></p>
<p>Having wrested the throne from the Angevin monarchs, Alfonso V has secured the Kingdom of Naples for his illegitimate son Ferdinand.  Before dying in 1458, he attempted to protect Albania via vassalage; he owed a debt for their aid during his own invasion and was inspired by their string of victories against the waxing Turkish threat.  <em>If we are to maintain our position of power we must not shirk from our opportunities to assert it.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Milan - Patron Saint Ambrose</h2></center></p> <p><strong>The religious war has concluded and there are no Protestant nations in the regions of Italy.</strong></p>
<p>Milan embraces Saint Ambrose as its patron Saint.  In times of strength we go as far as to consecrate our Republican tradition in his memory.  A stalwart defender of Roman Catholic tradition, Ambrose was beleaguered by heretical doctrines spreading during his era.  It is obvious how Saint Ambrose would act when faced with the <strong>plague</strong> that is Protestantism, and we are compelled to act in accordance with his wishes.</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Savoy - Break the French Yoke</h2></center></p> <p><strong>Exceed the development of France.</strong></p>
<p>Savoy has long been sovereign, yet the courtiers of Europe rarely acknowledge the Duke of Savoy as much more than a steward who prepares the earth it rests on for France’s inevitable occupation.  If France were to be weakened substantially we could finally forge a destiny <em>of our own.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Tunis - Axe to Grind</h2></center></p> <p><strong>Simultaneously hold the entire island of Sicily and the province of Rome.</strong></p>
<p>Tunis, the geographic successor state to Ancient Carthage, is overdue for retribution against the remnants of ancient Rome.  Time has eroded the customs and creeds of our ancestors – conjuring new mutual causes for strife.  There is bound to be a sadistic pleasure in realizing Hannibal’s ambitions, <em>even if our counterblow comes a thousand years too late.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Florence - Chancellor Niccolo Machiavelli</h2></center></p> <p><strong>Unite enough Italian states to create the Kingdom of Italy.</strong></p>
<p>Our diplomats are singing new songs following the unexpected appointment of a previously <em>exiled</em> man as Chancellor…</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Genoa - Barbary Crusade</h2></center><p> <p><strong>Eliminate the Tunisian player.</strong></p>
<p>Genoa has long aspired to the greatness of Venice.  We compete for Mediterranean trade-posts, maintain fleets of galleys to rival Venice’s naval prowess, and we even mimic the Venetian brand of Republican government.  How better to overshadow our rival than to do what they have not?  Purging Tunis from the map will strengthen us physically, but more importantly…<em>in the eyes of our peers.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Venice - Venetian Opportunism</h2></center></p> <p><strong>If no other player has achieved their goal by the end of the timeline, then all were undoubtedly thwarted by the machinations of the mischievous Venetian player.  <em>Therefore, Venice wins.</em></strong></p>
<p>Only Venetian cunning could keep a Republic so well preserved in such an age of barbarous monarchism.  Founded in 431 A.D. – we’ve borne witness to the fall of western Rome, we’ve outlasted our republican peers in Pisa and Amalfi, and we’ve even enlisted <strong>crusaders</strong> as mercenaries to maintain our interests.  <em>Despite contributing to the collapse of eastern Rome</em> – we ensure our presence in their final hour.  We’ll usher the French into Milan when it suits us and we’ll resume our Papal servitude when it doesn’t.  The blatant, clumsy emulation displayed by the Genoese flirts with a certain flattery that only encourages our behavior.</p>
