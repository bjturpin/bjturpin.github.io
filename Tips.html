  <p>"Try not to pay any mind to what you might overhear...all these hot-heads are blithering idiots if you ask me."</p>
  <h2><center>The military officer from Naples looks quite old...</center></h2>
<p>"Can you believe that fat oaf in Aragon?  Support the Albanians?!  This is folly.  A miraculous display for him at the expense of the Neapolitans.  There have been rumors that his son Ferdinand has aspirations of his own.  If I were tasked with a suicide mission, I'd sever this abusive union.  Ha!  Come to think of it...routing the Ottomans would curry great favor with the Holy Father.  Aye, if we were sovereign it is a lot less rotten of an idea, politically speaking.  Bah, the years it will take to set such a thing into motion.  Skanderbeg is a titan but not even he will last long enough for us to bail him out.  He can join the ranks of his fellow prince's in exile at that point...unless he gets himself killed first.  There is a crusade currently, yet I hear it is going...poorly.  Maybe the honourable Austrians can find the time to lift a finger for the poor bastards in Albania.  Or...maybe the'll at least join us when we manage to get around to it.  Surely the Genoese and Venetians are concerned about their trade empires?  Hard to tell.  Can't really trust those merchants to do anything other than count ducats."</p>
<h2><center>A Florentine noble sullenly orders his seventh ale...</center></h2>
<p>"Lorenzo has gone mad!  A republican...why!  He has managed to bring ruin to Florence with that silver tongue.  "Unite the Italian states" he says, like that is remotely possible.  Once the Duke of Milan and the two Serene Doges catch wind of any Florentine wars of aggression we'll be met with a seven-nation coalition and promptly dismantled.  Oh, and the Pope!  Enjoy being bankrupt of any religious currency and repeatedly excommunicated, you imbeciles.  Do they plan on conspiring with the savages across the sea?  Will they brazenly enact the Statute of Restraint in Appeals?  The Swiss must have orchestrated this, damn spies!  Or was it Naples...or Savoy...?"</p>
<h2><center>A young woman is dressed in the height of French fashion...</center></h2>
<p>"Have you never heard of Savoy?  Were you raised by animals?  I'm not a liar, if I were <em>then</em> I would admit to being French.  No!  I'm not!  Yes, I speak it.  Look, I don't even like the French, though I prefer them to those Swiss barbarians.  Our Duke has been entertaining ambassadors from England, Aragon, Castile, Portugal and Austria; so, no I do not fear the empty threats of the Swiss and the French.  They are simply enjoying a geo-political anomaly that will soon be resolved.  Why are you laughing?  I'm not French!"</p>
<h2><center>This young member of house Sforza seems zealous...</center></h2>
<p>"If the Tunisians so much as utter a blasphemous phrase while they peddle their wares in the streets of Milan I just might sail off with the Genoese.  These mercenary-feuled skirmishes mean little; the end times are nigh and the great war is coming.  A holy war!  Hmm?  What crusade?  Oh...right, the Balkans.  No, that is all well and fine I wish them the best but I have heard rumors of Germans translating the greek gospels into their common tongue.  Heresy!  The Holy See will hear of this and there will be war.  I can smell heretics a mile away and I assure you that the Florentines and the Swiss are revisionists sent by Satan to undermine the Holy Father.  And what of the advocates to secede from the Empire?  Heretics..."</p>
<h2><center>A Genoese explorer has gathered an audience...</center></h2>
<p>"-flat?  Uhg, don't be a fool.  Ridicule me for getting thrown out of the courts of Iberia if you must, at least that is somewhat tenable.  Mark my words, there is uncontested trade on that horizon; with colonial revenue your little Crusade might be less of a pipe-dream.  I'll offer my advice to Savoy and Florence, if the lot of you won't have it.  When your trade route to the Sea of Azov is torn asunder you'll wish you paid mind to those ambassadors from Naples that you so myopically scoffed at.  What is your grand strategy anyways...trying to decide whether you prefer invasion from Savoy or Florence?  Perhaps they'll agree to split the land evenly..."</p>
<h2><center>The mercenary from Switzerland is blathering to anyone who will listen...</center></h2>
<p>"Talk of the tavern is that Savoy, Milan, and the Austrians are all squabbling over who gets to vassalize us!  My guess is the Duke will forge an alliance with Austria, hinting at an eventual annexation.  This gets Milan and Savoy to piss <em>right off</em> and buys us decades to disappoint the archduke.  Hell, being the emperor of <em>this</em> empire keeps a man busy; he may even forget we exist if we can keep him on the throne.  An alliance could lead to becoming an electorate...well it may not matter.  I hear the Italians have the audacity to leave the empire soon, can you believe that?  If that's the case we may meet them on the battlefield under banners of the French army.  Just need to shift all these prying eyes off of us and onto those snail-eaters.  To France!"</p>
<h2><center>An exotic foreigner is struggling to speak Italian...</center></h2>
<p>"Ahlan wa Sahlan...er Ciao?  Are you from Florence?  No?  I'm here to rendezvous with a man from Florence.  Sorry, my Italian is limited.  Speaking of which I'm sure I'm misunderstanding something I overheard earlier near that crowd of people.  It sounded like they were talking about some "Barbary Crusade" but that cannot be correct, right?  They must have meant that war declared on our Ottoman brothers-in-faith, yeah?  Well, I won't keep you friend, I really must find this Florentine.
<h2><center>The merchant of Venice has the most opulent tunic you've ever seen...</center></h2>
<p>"What a night to be alive my friend.  Did you see that young woman?  Why is she pretending she is not French?  Strange girl.  You won't believe me, but hear me out...I'm soon to publish a book!  I recently returned from trading in the Orient, it was...a long story.  Don't worry you can read all about it soon.  I'm sure it will be available in our <em>most serene</em> republic.  But, anyways, in the east I met people who believed in this idea of <em>"Karma"</em>.  Essentially, they think that reality will return the energy that you apply throughout your life to you in kind - potentially in a very bad, retributive way.  Isn't that absurd?!  Yes, I think it is.  One day in Venice and they would forget all that nonsense.  I hear the Swiss usher France into Provence while Savoy breathes a sigh of relief.  Pathetic!  Naples looks to the East naively while Tunis cannot look away from the past...and least of all, the Genoese seek to usurp both our trade dominance alongside our reputation.  They will all fade as curious debris in a timeline.  Hmm?  Oh, nothing, I was just rambling..."</p>
